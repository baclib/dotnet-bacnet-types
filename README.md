# .NET BACnet Types

A modern .NET library providing robust, reusable BACnet data types and contracts.

## Overview

This library is a **from-scratch implementation** of BACnet data types, incorporating decades of knowledge and best practices from both BACnet protocol evolution and modern software development.

By starting fresh, we apply lessons learned from existing implementations while leveraging the latest features and frameworks of the .NET ecosystem. This approach creates a robust foundation for developing BACnet applications that meet modern performance, security, and maintainability standards.

## Key Features

- Clean architecture following SOLID principles
- Focus on data types and structures relevant to BACnet
- Comprehensive support for all data types used in standard APDUs
- Easily extendable and adaptable to new and existing codebases
- Highly testable and maintainable design
