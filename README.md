# .NET BACnet Types

A modern .NET library providing robust, reusable BACnet data types.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** This project is under active development. APIs may change as the project evolves.

## Overview

This library is a **from-scratch implementation** of BACnet data types, incorporating decades of knowledge and best practices from both BACnet protocol evolution and modern software development.

By starting fresh, we apply lessons learned from existing implementations while leveraging the latest features and frameworks of the .NET ecosystem. This approach creates a robust foundation for developing BACnet applications that meet modern performance, security, and maintainability standards.

## The BAClib Initiative

The BAClib Initiative is a primarily recreational effort dedicated to building automation and control, providing free, libre, and open source software for everyone. Drawing on decades of experience with BACnet protocols and implementations, this initiative aims to create modern, well-designed tools and libraries that benefit the entire building automation community.

As a volunteer-driven project developed in contributors' free time, progress follows the natural pace of recreational development rather than commercial timelines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To Potential Contributors:** This project is in its initial phase, with foundational decisions and architecture still being established. Direct code contributions are challenging at this stage without internal knowledge of the project's direction and design goals.
>
> However, we warmly welcome feedback, ideas, and suggestions that will help shape the project as it matures.
